- Credential Management: Shift away from hardcoded credentials towards secure storage methods like environment variables.

- Input Validation: Implement rigorous validation to prevent injection attacks and ensure only valid input is accepted.

- Error Handling: Implement robust error handling to prevent leakage of sensitive information.

- Authentication & Authorization: Strengthen mechanisms for authentication and authorization, including encryption and secure session management.
